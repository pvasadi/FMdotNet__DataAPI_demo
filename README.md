# FMdotNet__DataAPI_demo
Console application that demonstrates the FMdotNET__DataAPI calls and responses.

==> NOTE: FileMaker Server 17 was released on 15 May 2018 and with it the official Data API.  Which is different than the one with FileMaker Server 16.  The 16 Data API will stop working at the end of September 2018.  There is a new demo application that works with FileMaker Server 17 here: https://github.com/wimdecorte/fmDotNet__DataAPI_Demo_17

Modify the App.config.sample to include your server's DNS name and remove the '.sample' from the file name.

Remember to host the sample FM files on your server: the_UI.fmp12 and the_Data.fmp12, or modify the console app to target one of your files.
